The goal is to fill the maximum amount of outlines (German: Umrisse) by falling differently shaped pieces -- tetris stones (German: Steine), or "polyomino". These stones are generated randomaly and have a defined dimentions (k\*k). Each outline is the combination of two stones, having a polyform shape. There are also parking spots (German: Parkplatz), where it is possible to store ("park") the stones if there is no time to put it into the outline or the stone in the outline is occupied. 

With a user interface the player can choose the number of falling pieces, their dimension (k), speed of the game, the number of outlines and parking plases, colors, and acceleration (yes or now). Using the mouse, the player can select one of the falling stones, manipulate it (rotate, reflect) and place it on the outline or parking spot, which are also selected with the mouse or keyboard. As soon as at least one falling stone touches the lower edge of the playing field, the game is over. Detailed rules of the game can be found in the game instruction (Spielanleitung).
